# USE OF MY PROJECT #
My whitelist is a database of wallet addresses that receive early access to an NFT collection before its public launch. Those on the whitelist have the option of buying newly released NFTs before the rest of the market, and at much lower transaction fees. With its decentralized feauture ,it is free from the control and interferance of a single authority, safeguarding of user privacy, flexibility of development.

 # DESCRIPTION #
On building my project, i made use of hardhat (Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development in Solidity. In simple words, i wrote my smart contract, deploy them, run tests, and debug my code). i created a javascript project, wrote a smart contract and deployed to GOERLI network,I installed dotenv package to be able to import the env file and use it in the config. and compiled the contract.

WEBSITE
I developed the website using react and next.js (React is a javascript framework used to make websites and Next.js is a React framework that also allows writing backend APIs code along with the frontend, so you don't need two separate frontend and backend services.) i creacted a new next-app, installed web3modal, also ether.js and downloaded an image online for the UI.

And finnally deployed it to vercel app, so that all could view and have access to it.
